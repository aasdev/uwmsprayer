uwmsprayer is a set of routines to generate prayer times, hijri dates,
and prayer calendars for the Upper Westchester Muslim Society (UWMS)
in NY (http://www.uwms.org). It
uses the ITL library from the Arabeyes project
(http://projects.arabeyes.org) as the basis for hijri and prayer time
calculations, with localizations for UWMS in the uwmsprayer.h header
file.  The program can be localized for different areas by modifying
the header file appropriately.

INSTALLATION

just run 'make' at the top level, should compile on most Linux
distros. It will first make the ITL library followed by uwmsprayer utility.
