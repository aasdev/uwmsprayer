Al Salam Alykom Wa Rahmat Allah Wa Barakatoh.

This directory contains on-going work that pertains to the generation
of Hijri date generators and converters.

The idea is to create a library-module which, based on user input,
can generate and convert Hijri dates based on a variety of calculation
methods.

There are a few means to generate a binary compiled output,

+ Via the main/root entire-package compile method
  - Follows the instructions outlined in the main/root README file

+ Via the main/root single component compile method
  - In the main/root ITL directory,
    -- If source is from CVS, run './autogen.sh'
    -- Run 'make components'

+ Via a local single library-module method
  - In the main/root ITL directory,
    -- If source is from CVS, run './autogen.sh'
    -- Run 'make' here
